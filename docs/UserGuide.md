# Moddie User Guide

Moddie is a **desktop app for managing schedules, interests, and tags of contacts optimized for use via a Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Moddie can get your contact and schedule management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `Moddie.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Moddie.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar Moddie.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

The schedule display allows users to be able to view the schedule of their classmates and determine if there are any conflicts in timing. 

1) When there is no conflict between the schedules, the schedule would be displayed with a black border as shown below.
![img.png](img.png)

2) The schedule which the user would like to view can be done using the dropdown box which displays all the names that of the 
classmates within the contact list.

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

3) If 2 or more people are participants in the same schedule, the schedule border would be colored blue and it would called
'Group schedule'. 
![img_5.png](img_5.png)
By hovering over the Group schedule, you would be able to view all the participants of that specific group schedule.
![img_4.png](img_4.png)

4) If there is a conflict in schedule between 2 people, the schedule border would be colored red. Both schedules would still 
display each of their own timings.
![img_2.png](img_2.png)

Important Notes: 
* The schedule can only display up to 5 user schedules at a time. If you have selected 5 people from the dropdown box and 
want to select a 6th person, you would need to unselect one of the 5 currently selected people by clicking on their name in the 
dropdown box again. 



### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
